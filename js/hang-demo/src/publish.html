		Use the included Web Component to render a preview and simple controls.
		You can set the url in publish.ts based on query parameters.
		That's optional of course, you could instead add: url="http://localhost:4443/demo/me.hang"

	<h3>Other demos:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="index.html?name=demo/me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" id="watch">Watch your broadcast: <span
					id="watch-name"></span></a></li>
		<li><a href="index.html">Watch the handsome bunny instead.</a></li>
		<li><a href="announce.html">List all active broadcasts.</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tips:</h3>
	<p>
		This page creates a broadcast called `demo/me` by default.
		You can use <a href="index.html?&name=demo/notme">query parameters</a> to use a different name and create
		multiple broadcasts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Reusing the same broadcast name means viewers will automatically reconnect to the new session.
		Try reloading the page and broadcasting again; viewers will automatically reconnect!
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		Media only flows over the network when requested!
		Connecting to a relay means the broadcast is advertised as available, but nothing is transferred until there's
		at least one viewer per track.
		If there's multiple viewers, the relay will fan out the media to all of them.
		<b>TODO</b>: We still encode media even when there are no viewers, but somebody should improve this.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can create a broadcaster via the provided <code class="language-html">&lt;hang-publish&gt;</code> <a
			href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Component</a>.
		Either modify HTML attributes like <code class="language-html">&lt;hang-publish device="camera" /&gt;</code>
		or access the element's Javascript API:
	<pre><code class="language-typescript">const publish = document.getElementById("publish");
publish.lib.device = "camera";</code></pre>

	And of course you can use the Javascript API directly instead of the Web Component.
	It's a bit more complicated and subject to change, but it gives you more control.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		You're not limited to web publishing either.
		Try running <code class="language-bash">just pub tos</code> in a new terminal and then <a
			href="index.html?name=tos" target="_blank">watch robots bang</a>.
		This uses ffmpeg to produce a fragmented MP4 file piped over stdout then sent over the network.
		Yeah it's pretty gross.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to do things more efficiently, you can use the <i>alpha</i> gstreamer plugin via:
		<code class="language-bash">just pub-gst tos</code>.
		It's pretty crude and doesn't handle all pipeline events; contributions welcome!
	</p>
	<p>
		And if you're feeing extra adventurous, use <code class="language-bash">just sub-gst tos</code> to <i>watch</i>
		via gstreamer.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>
		This demo uses `http://` so it's not secure.
		It works by fetching the certificate hash (via HTTP) and providing that to WebTransport, which requires HTTPS.
		To run this in production, you'll need a valid certificate (ex. letsencrypt) and to use `https://`.
